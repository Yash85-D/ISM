            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there!</p> 
            <p>I'm Danda Yashwanth. I am an MBA professional  who has worked in operations, strategic planning, product management, and market analysis for more than two years. Currently I'm pursuing my masters in Business Analytics and information systems at the University of South Florida. </p>
                <p> I'm interested in using data to improve product performance and operational effectiveness. I had experience of working as Associate Program Manager in AgroStar where I managed a product portfolio worth $50 million. I was responsible for product strategy and revenue. I'm good with excel, Power BI, R, Tableau, Python, and SQL. </p>
                    <p> Working with BYJUS, UPL, Syngenta and Dhanuka Agritech as an intern made me better understand market research and strategic marketing. I like making decisions that are data-driven to enhance organizational performance. </p>
                        <p>I am here to share you the latest motorcycle news through this website</p>
